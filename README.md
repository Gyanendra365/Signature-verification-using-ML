Signature continue to be an important biometric for 
authenticating the identity of human beings. This Image 
processing project presents an effective method to perform Off
line signature verification using unique structural features 
extracted from the signature's contour. A novel combination of 
Modified Direction Feature (MDF) and additional distinguishing 
features such as the centroid, baseline area, length and skew are 
used for classification. This project involves the design and 
development of an efficient signature identification system. The 
pattern recognition algorithm designed for this project is based 
on general architecture of signature identification system.
